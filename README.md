# Five Dice Frenzy
**A simple and fun Yahtzee! clone for the browser**

This project is a minimalist clone of the game Yahtzee! to play on the go. 
It incorporates responsive design practices to work well on mobile devices and varying screen sizes and browser versions.

Five Dice Frenzy has been designed for performance and originally a means to practice JavaScript and CSS skills; First implemented using vanilla JavaScript, the latest version has migrated the logic to use jQuery for greater browser compatibility as well as more concise code.
